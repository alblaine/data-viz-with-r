```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message=FALSE)

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library("magick")
library("highcharter")
library("leaflet")
library("plotly")
```

## Workshop goals 

* learn about various packages for making data visualizations in R 
* be able to determine which package to use 
* understand basic syntax for the popular packages
* learn basic design principles for effective communication
* gain hands-on practice making different visualization types

## What is R?

R is a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Using R you can do rigorous statistical analysis, clean and manipulate data, and create publication-quality graphics.

## Popular R packages for data viz 

* ggplot2
* highcharter
* leaflet
* plotly

## Core R functions for plotting

You can create graphs in R without installing a package. However, there are benefits to creating your visualizations using an R package versus the core R plot functions, including: 

* you can create more attractive visualizations
* easier to create publication-quality graphs 
*

## highcharter

```{r}
data(citytemp)

hc <- highchart() %>% 
  hc_xAxis(categories = citytemp$month) %>% 
  hc_add_series(name = "Tokyo", data = citytemp$tokyo) %>% 
  hc_add_series(name = "London", data = citytemp$london) %>% 
  hc_add_series(name = "Other city",
                data = (citytemp$tokyo + citytemp$london)/2)

hc
```
  
## leaflet

```{r}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-78.6697, lat=35.7876,
    popup="You are here")
m  # Print the map

```
  
## plotly

```{r}
p <- plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop)
p
```
  
## Deciding on the right package

* Do you want your visualizations to be interactive or static?
* Do you want to use R Markdown/knitr to publish your visualization?
* Do you want to create a dashboard for multiple vizzes?
* Are you creating your visualization for a commercial or government purpose?
* Do you need to do something sophisticated with geospatial data?
